Preprocessing of diffusion MRI (dMRI) involves numerous steps to clean and standardize
the data before voxel-wise diffusion modeling.
Generally, researchers create ad hoc preprocessing workflows for each dataset,
building upon a large inventory of available tools.
The complexity of these workflows has snowballed with rapid advances in
acquisition and processing.
dMRIPrep is an analysis-agnostic tool that addresses the challenge of robust and
reproducible preprocessing for dMRI data.
dMRIPrep automatically adapts a best-in-breed workflow to the idiosyncrasies of
virtually any dataset, ensuring high-quality preprocessing without manual intervention.
dMRIPrep robustly produces high-quality results on diverse dMRI data.
Additionally, dMRIPrep introduces less uncontrolled spatial smoothness than observed
with commonly used preprocessing tools.
dMRIPrep equips neuroscientists with an easy-to-use and transparent preprocessing
workflow, which can help ensure the validity of inference and the interpretability
of results.
