# PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS

This documents the key personnel who oversees the development of the Project and secures funding.
The names in this file are designated by the Organization's TSC at the time of accepting the Project under the Organization.
Changes to this file must be approved by the TSC.
When a PI ceases serving as such, by default, their name will be placed in the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file should it not be there already.
