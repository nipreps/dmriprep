  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: mapped, suffix: fieldmap}
    caption: Inhomogeneities of the <em>B<sub>0</sub></em> field introduce (oftentimes severe) spatial distortions
      along the phase-encoding direction of the image. Some scanners produce a <em>B<sub>0</sub></em>
      mapping of the field, using Spiral Echo Imaging (SEI) or postprocessing a "phase-difference"
      acquisition. The plot below shows an anatomical "magnitude" reference and the corresponding
      fieldmap.

      field inhomogeneity in Hertz.

      along the phase-encoding direction of the image. A Gradient-Recalled Echo (GRE) scheme for the 
      mapping of the <em>B<sub>0</sub></em> inhomogeneities by subtracting the phase maps obtained at
      two subsequent echoes. The plot below shows an anatomical "magnitude" reference and the corresponding
      fieldmap.

    caption: Inhomogeneities of the <em>B<sub>0</sub></em> field introduce (oftentimes severe) spatial distortions
      along the phase-encoding direction of the image. Utilizing two or more images with different
      phase-encoding polarities (PEPolar) or directions, it is possible to estimate the inhomogeneity
      of the field. The plot below shows a reference EPI (echo-planar imaging) volume generated
      using two or more EPI images with varying phase-encoding blips.

    caption: Inhomogeneities of the <em>B<sub>0</sub></em> field introduce (oftentimes severe) spatial distortions
      along the phase-encoding direction of the image. Utilizing an <em>anatomically-correct</em> acquisition
      (for instance, T1w or T2w), it is possible to estimate the inhomogeneity of the field by means of nonlinear
      registration. The plot below shows a reference EPI (echo-planar imaging) volume generated
      using two or more EPI images with the same PE encoding, after alignment to the anatomical scan.
