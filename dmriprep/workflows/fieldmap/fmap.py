.. _sdc_direct_b0 :
Direct B0 mapping sequences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When the fieldmap is directly measured with a prescribed sequence (such as
:abbr:`SE (spiral echo)`), we only need to calculate the corresponding B-Spline
coefficients to adapt the fieldmap to the TOPUP tool.
This procedure is described with more detail `here <https://cni.stanford.edu/\
wiki/GE_Processing#Fieldmaps>`__.
This corresponds to the section 8.9.3 --fieldmap image (and one magnitude image)--
of the BIDS specification.
